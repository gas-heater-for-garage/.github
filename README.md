# Gas Heater For Garage - What You Need to Know

Before purchasing a gas heater for your garage, it's essential to research how many BTUs (British Thermal Units) it will produce and if it will fit within your space. Furthermore, installation requirements, including ventilation and safety, must also be considered before purchasing one. It's highly advised to hire professional installers if possible, as they can connect it directly to the gas line at home while meeting all local codes and safety regulations.

## Key Considerations Before Buying [Gas Heater for Garage](https://www.omarhvac.ca/post/garage-gas-heater-buying-guide), carefully compare its features and specifications against models available to determine which best meets your needs. Factors to keep in mind include:
- Square footage of your space
- How often you use the garage
- Additional safety and functionality features
- Whether or not constant heating is needed for certain activities or just periodic heating

Consideration should be given to the size and insulation levels of your garage when selecting a heater, with larger spaces needing more BTUs than smaller spaces. A general guideline suggests **20-30 BTUs per square foot** as an average minimum. However, this number could change depending on the garage designâ€”two-car garages, for example, typically need more BTUs than sheds or workshops.

## Types of Heating Options

Some models provide multiple heating options, including:
- **Radiant Heating**: Ideal for living spaces or family rooms.
- **Forced Air Heating**: Works better in workshops or "she-sheds."

### Additional Features to Consider:
- **Digital Thermostat**: An easy-to-read digital display that lets you set a specific temperature.
- **Remote Control**: Added convenience for adjusting settings.
- **Emergency Shutoff**: A function for safety in case of emergencies.
- **Carbon Monoxide Detectors**: Some models come equipped with detectors to detect potentially hazardous levels of this invisible gas.

## Safety and Certification

When selecting a gas garage heater, look for one certified by an established organization with a strong history of quality and reliability. Always follow key safety guidelines, such as:
- Never modifying your heater
- Keeping the heater away from flammable materials like gasoline or paint
- Ensuring proper ventilation to avoid dangerously high levels of carbon monoxide emissions

## Maintenance Tips

As well as following these tips, regularly clean your garage heater to keep it operating at peak efficiency. Dust and debris can clog the combustion process, reducing efficiency and potentially increasing fire risks. Inspect your unit for signs of wear or damage, such as loose or cracked parts. Have it professionally inspected at least annually to check for potential issues and clean the heater, ensuring it keeps your garage warm all winter long.
